        "\n",

        "making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\n",

        "out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on, Alice\n",
        "started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never\n",

        "out of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after\n",

        "to be a very deep well.\n",
        "\n",
        "Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\n",
        "plenty of time, as she went down, to look about her. First, she tried to\n",
        "make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything;\n",
        "then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were\n",
        "filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and\n",
        "pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as\n",
        "she passed. It was labeled \"ORANGE MARMALADE,\" but, to her great\n",
        "disappointment, it was empty; she did not like to drop the jar, so\n",
        "managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Down, down, down! Would the fall never come to an end? There was nothing\n",
        "else to do, so Alice soon began talking to herself. \"Dinah'll miss me\n",
        "very much to-night, I should think!\" (Dinah was the cat.) \"I hope\n",
        "they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear, I wish\n",
        "you were down here with me!\" Alice felt that she was dozing off, when\n",
        "suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry\n",
        "leaves, and the fall was over.\n",
        "\n",
        "Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up in a moment. She looked up,\n",
        "but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage and\n",
        "the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a\n",
        "moment to be lost. Away went Alice like the wind and was just in time to\n",
        "hear it say, as it turned a corner, \"Oh, my ears and whiskers, how late\n",
        "it's getting!\" She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but\n",
        "the Rabbit was no longer to be seen.\n",
        "\n",
        "She found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of\n",
        "lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all 'round the hall, but\n",
        "they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side\n",
        "and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,\n",
        "wondering how she was ever to get out again.\n",
        "\n",
        "Suddenly she came upon a little table, all made of solid glass. There\n",
        "was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice's first idea was that\n",
        "this might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the\n",
        "locks were too large, or the key was too small, but, at any rate, it\n",
        "would not open any of them. However, on the second time 'round, she came\n",
        "upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a\n",
        "little door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key\n",
        "in the lock, and to her great delight, it fitted!\n",
        "\n",
        "[Illustration]\n",
        "\n",
        "Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\n",
        "much larger than a rat-hole; she knelt down and looked along the passage\n",
        "into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of\n",
        "that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and\n",
        "those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the\n",
        "doorway. \"Oh,\" said Alice, \"how I wish I could shut up like a telescope!\n",
        "I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Alice went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on\n",
        "it, or at any rate, a book of rules for shutting people up like\n",
        "telescopes. This time she found a little bottle on it (\"which certainly\n",
        "was not here before,\" said Alice), and tied 'round the neck of the\n",
        "bottle was a paper label, with the words \"DRINK ME\" beautifully printed\n",
        "on it in large letters.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"No, I'll look first,\" she said, \"and see whether it's marked '_poison_'\n",
        "or not,\" for she had never forgotten that, if you drink from a bottle\n",
        "marked \"poison,\" it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or\n",
        "later. However, this bottle was _not_ marked \"poison,\" so Alice ventured\n",
        "to taste it, and, finding it very nice (it had a sort of mixed flavor of\n",
        "cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffy and hot buttered\n",
        "toast), she very soon finished it off.\n",

        "\n",
        "And so it was indeed! She was now only ten inches high, and her face\n",

        "through the little door into that lovely garden.\n",
        "\n",
        "After awhile, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\n",
        "into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! When she got to the\n",
        "door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\n",
        "went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\n",
        "it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her\n",
        "best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery,\n",
        "and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\n",
        "sat down and cried.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Come, there's no use in crying like that!\" said Alice to herself rather\n",

        "\n",
        "She ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself, \"Which way? Which\n",
